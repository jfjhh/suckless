dmenu-pango-imlib - dynamic menu (with pango && imlib)
====================
Pango and imlib patched dmenu.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dmenu-pango-imlib you need the Xlib, pango and imlib header/library files


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dmenu is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dmenu
(if necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dmenu
-------------
See the man page for details.

Thumbnails get cached according to XDG thumbnail spec.
http://specifications.freedesktop.org/thumbnail-spec/thumbnail-spec-latest.html

Pass -g to generate thumbnails immediatly for the piped images.
Pass -is to specify image size (keeping aspect ratio).
Pass -ia to specify image alignment (top-center/center/top/bottom/*-gapless, where top-center is default)
Note, that using too big images cause slowdown because images are loaded each time, selection image differs from last image.

Example pipe listing with images:
IMG:/mnt/pictures/lolcat.jpg\tThis is a lolcat\n
IMG:/mnt/pictures/david.jpg\tThis is a picture of david\n
This is a item without a picture\n

Additional options:
Pass -si to specify starting index to dmenu.
ex. -si 5 to start from item 5.
